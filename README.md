## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/8BR9J9b/398shots-so.png)

This is my recreation of devchallenges' #3 challenge, a small simulation of an Airbnb. I created this project using React, Tailwind and CSS. The project is capable of faithfully recreating each of the required functionalities, along with some new ones like being able to view all the records.


### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

* This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/3JFYedSOZqAxYuOCNmYD) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

* You can display all stays again by simply tapping on the location you had previously selected and then clicking the search button.

* The filters you selected will not reset when closing the page, allowing the user to avoid frustration in case of accidental page reload.

* The application is 100% responsive and faithfully replicated, thanks to the resources provided by the devChallenges team.
